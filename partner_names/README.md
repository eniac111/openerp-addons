# OpenERP 7.0 module: 
# Partner Names Extension

  
This AddOn provides two additional name fields for partners in OpenERP 7.0.

It is common experience, that quite often the single name field provided by OpenERP standard simply isn't 
enough space to specify a customer's name.

Hence this AddOn was developed to provide two more name fields. 
Of course, the search fetaures and 'display_name' functionality is adapted to the new fields.

## Details

Extends the Partner form/treeview/kanban by two new name fields.
  - Form View:
    - Name 2
    - Name 3  
  - Tree View:
    - Name 2
  - Kanban View:
    - Name 2 (included in Kanban Box Heading)

## Important Note

In case you would like to have those fields also printed (ie on quotations, sale orders, invoices, etc) 
- which I find quite likely - you must add the new fields to your report definitions.
